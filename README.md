Code for this project can be broken into two segments: Utilities & Main.

Utilities are functions that are necessary for processing the ecHT device output, statistical procedures, or aesthic processes like figure generation.

Main are scripts that call upon data and the functions within Utilities in order to generate the analyses and figures from the manuscript.

Additionally, all analyses assume user has the following MATLAB toolboxes:

  1. Circular Statistics
  2. Chronux
  3. Signal Processing
  4. EEGLAB
